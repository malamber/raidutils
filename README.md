Welcome to our new raid repository.

Getting Started:
* Register an account on http://www.github.com.
* Send your username to Mal to be added as an authorized user
* Download and install Git from here https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.42.0.windows.2/Git-2.42.0.2-64-bit.exe

for anyone new to using git source control, get this free client https://tortoisegit.org/download/.

Once installed, open macroquest/lua in your file explorer.  Right-click an empty area.  You should see a new option for Tortoise Git.  Select the option "Clone Repository"  In the first field, enter "https://github.com/malamber/raidutils.git" then hit clone.  You may be asked to authenticate with your browser.  Should be straight forward.  After that, you should see all the files being pulled and a new directory called raidutils.
